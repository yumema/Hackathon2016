# Hackathon 2016

Using Cortical.io’s Natural Language Processing API, automatically sort emails, tickets, reviews, descriptions, etc. into categories rather than relying human interaction.
### REQUIREMENTS / SETUP

-  To use, ensure you have a file called apiStorage.py to contain your api key.
   Use vi to open .gitignore and add the line "apiStorage.py". (This will prevent you from accidentally uploading your api key)

-  You'll need to install the retinasdk:
   pip install retinasdk
   (For obtaining pip, see https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/ )
